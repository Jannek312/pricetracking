# Price Tracking

Price Tracking is a tool that allows you to create price histories and be alerted when the price of a particular product changes to find the best time to buy new fancy items.


## Installation

1. Execute the price-tracking.jar to create the default price-tracking.properties
2. Configure the price-tracking.properties
2. Execute the price-tracking.jar with first parameter true to init the database tables.
3. Run the jar in a linux screen or something similar


## Usage

Not that much yet. Currently you can only maintain the database manually to add new products or view the price history.


## TODO's

* Logging
* sql caching
